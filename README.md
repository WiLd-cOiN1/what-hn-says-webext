## About
Dead-simple yet very useful web extension that looks for threads on popular social news aggregator [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) via [HN Search API powered by Algolia](https://hn.algolia.com/api). I hacked this togheter in a few hours because I was unable to find something not bloated: For your privacy and general browser performance this extension fetches the API only when the popup is clicked and does not run any background script. It also requires minimum permissions (just `activeTab` actually).

## Install
Get the extension for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/what-hacker-news-says/) or [Chrome/Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/what-hacker-news-says/khgegkjchclhgpglloficdmdannlpmoi) browsers.

You can also clone this repo and manually run it as an unpacked extension (but losing automatic future updates).

## Changelog
